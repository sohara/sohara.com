> A skilled full-stack engineer with over two decades of experience in multiple platforms and frameworks, I value pragmatic decision-making applied to products that embody sound design and long-term maintainability. Most recently I have focussed on application development with **React**, **Typescript** and **Node.js**.

## Professional Experience

- ### Bread Financial
  _[ Software Engineer (Full-time contractor) | 2020 - 2023 ]_
  As technical lead for the consumer-facing experience of Bread’s pay-over-time financing platform, I 
  developed the front-end application based using **React**, **Typescript**,  **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**.
  I also designed and developed a **Javascript** SDK for the platform in use by merchants such as Wayfair.com.
  My responsibilities included authoring technical specifications for the above initiatives and assisting in documentation efforts.
  I collaborated with platform teams to integrate with micro service APIs and mentored other developers during on-boarding and subsequent career development.

- ### SoulCycle Inc.
  _[ Software Engineer (Full-time contractor) | 2019-2020 ]_
  I led the development of a **Next.js** application for home and marketing pages integrated with a headless CMS. Additionally I worked on a number of Node.js micro-services and a legacy **PHP** monolith application.

  _[ Senior Software Engineer | Aug 2014 - Dec 2017 ]_
  Condé Nast's Copilot project is an in-house digital publishing platform that powers over 20 properties including Vogue, Wired, New Yorker and Pitchfork. I joined the team in 2014 focussing on the client-side editorial application, a single page application written in **Javascript** using the **Ember.js** framework. I stewarded the project's transition to Ember-Cli and successive upgrades from version 1.6 to 3.2. I oversaw the development of an extensive testing suite for the project, and its subsequent upgrades. As a senior member of a team of about 10 engineers I balanced pragmatic decision making with an abundance of enthusiasm for the technology while mentoring my teammates.

  I was the senior developer on a large **Ruby on Rails** ecommerce application for this Manhattan-based hardware startup.

I collaborated with multiple teams within the organization to fulfill feature requirements from initial requirements exploration through specing, design, development, Q/A and deployment.
