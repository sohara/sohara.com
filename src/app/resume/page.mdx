> A skilled full-stack engineer with over two decades of experience in multiple platforms and frameworks, I value pragmatic decision-making applied to products that embody sound design and long-term maintainability. I have recently focussed on single page javascript applications using Ember.js.

## Professional Experience

- **O'Hara Industries**
  _[ Software Consultant | January 2018 to present ]_

  Since last year I have worked as a remote consultant with Condé Nast as my primary client. I continued to support the Copilot team that I worked with when I was an employee (see below), focussing on a platform extensibility project.

- **Condé Nast**
  _[ Senior Software Engineer | Aug 2014 - Dec 2017 ]_

  Condé Nast's Copilot project is an in-house digital publishing platform that powers over 20 properties including Vogue, Wired, New Yorker and Pitchfork. I joined the team in 2014 focussing on the client-side editorial application, a single page application written in Javascript using the Ember.js framework. I stewarded the project's transition to Ember-Cli and successive upgrades from version 1.6 to 3.2. I oversaw the development of an extensive testing suite for the project, and its subsequent upgrades. As a senior member of a team of about 10 engineers I balanced pragmatic decision making with an abundance of enthusiasm for the technology while mentoring my teammates.

- **littleBits Electronics**
  _[ Senior Developer | Jul 2013 - Jun 2014 ]_

  I was the senior developer on a large Ruby on Rails ecommerce application for this Manhattan-based hardware startup. I was responsible for software design, TDD-based implementation, cloud-based devops, and managing code contributions from external and remote teams. I collaborated with multiple teams within the organization to fulfill feature requirements from initial requirements exploration through specing, design, development, Q/A and deployment.

- **Stresslimit Design**
  _[ Web Developer | Dec 2010 - 2013 ]_

  I worked on a variety of software applications for several consultancy clients, providing them with full-stack web applications developed in Ruby on Rails. I played the role of lead developer from project inception and design, following through with iterative development sprints. I also provided extended maintenance for long-lived applications.

- **Constellation Records**
  _[ Web Developer | Jan 2008 - Apr 2010 ]_

  I developed a custom Ruby on Rails-based web site and ecommerce platform for Constellation Records, an internationally recognized record company. The application provided both a custom content management system and as well as payment gateway integration and an administration back-end.

- **Alien8 Recordings**
  _[ President and Co-Founder | Jul 1996 – 2010 ]_

  In addition to co-founding and operating an independent record label for over thirteen years I was responsible for the multiple iterations of the company’s web presence, developing custom e-commerce platforms in Perl, PHP and Ruby on Rails.
