> I am a web application developer with over 20 years of experience. I caught the Ruby bug in 2006 and I have since applied Test Driven Development and design patterns to my craft. In the last 5 years I have focussed on Javascript application development, primarly employing the Ember.js framework. I relish the satisfaction of delivering quality applications and rich, intuitive user experiences.

## Professional Experience

- **Software Consultant**
  **O'Hara Industries**
  _January 2018 to present_

  Since last year I have worked as a remote consultant with Condé Nast as my primary client. I continued to support the Copilot team that I worked with when I was an employee (see below), focussing on a platform extensibility project.

- **Senior Software Engineer**
  **Condé Nast**
  _August 2014 to December 2017_

  Condé Nast's Copilot project is an in-house digital publishing platform that powers over 20 properties including Vogue, Wired, New Yorker and Pitchfork. I joined the team in 2014 focussing on the client-side editorial application, a single page application written in Javascript using the Ember.js framework. I stewarded the project's transition to Ember-Cli and successive upgrades from version 1.6 to 3.2. I oversaw the development of an extensive testing suite for the project, and its subsequent upgrades. As a senior member of a team of about 10 engineers I balanced pragmatic decision making with an abundance of enthusiasm for the technology while mentoring my teammates.

- **Senior Developer**
  **littleBits Electronics**
  _July 2013 to June 2014_

  I was the senior developer on a large Ruby on Rails ecommerce application for this Manhattan-based hardware startup. I was responsible for software design, TDD-based implementation, cloud-based devops, and managing code contributions from external and remote teams. I collaborated with multiple teams within the organization to fulfill feature requirements from initial requirements exploration through specing, design, development, Q/A and deployment.

- **Web Developer**
  **Stresslimit Design**
  _December 2010 to 2013_

  I worked on a variety of software applications for several consultancy clients, providing them with full-stack web applications developed in Ruby on Rails. I played the role of lead developer from project inception and design, following through with iterative development sprints. I also provided extended maintenance for long-lived applications.

- **Web Developer**
  **Constellation Records**
  _January 2008 to April 2010_

- **Alien8 Recordings**
  **President and Co-Founder**
