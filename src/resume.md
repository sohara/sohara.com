> I am a web application developer with over 15 years of experience. I caught the Ruby bug in 2006 and I have since acquired skills in Test Driven Development, Javascript application development, Object-Oriented Design and web devops. I prefer to work in teams adhering to agile development practices and relish the satisfaction of delivering quality applications and rich, intuitive user experiences.

## Professional Experience

  **Condé Nast**

  Condé Nast's Copilot project is an in-house digital publish platform that powers over 20 properties including Vogue, Wired, New Yorker and Pitchfork. I joined the team in 2014 focussing mostly on the client-side editorial application, a single page application written in Javascript using the Ember.js framework. I stewarded the project's transition to Ember-Cli and successive upgrades from version 1.6 to 3.2. I oversaw the development of an extensive testing suite for the project, and its subsequent upgrades. As a senior member of a team of up to 10 engineers I balanced pragmatic decision making with an abundance enthusiasm for the technology and mentoring my teammates.
